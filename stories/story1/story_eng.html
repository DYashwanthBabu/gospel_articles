      In spiritual life, whatever task we do, God must be in it. We need God's help. The task must be according to God's will; otherwise, the work may stop halfway and bring unbearable troubles and losses. Some people thought of building a tower up to the sky. Those who saw the tower would say, "Wow! Amazing! What a marvelous structure. Who built this?" And they wanted to say their own names. (Genesis 11:4) They were trying to build a tower for the sake of their name. In that construction, there was neither God's will nor His help. Why? Because there was no place for God in their thoughts or in their beginning. God was not in their plan.

      From the moment we wake up in the morning till we go to bed, we do many things. We take many journeys, make many efforts. In all our work and efforts, we need God's help. “Without Him, who can eat or find enjoyment?” (Ecclesiastes 2:25) says the Word of God. Never forget the truth that not even a single bite goes into our mouth without His permission.
      <br>
      Those so-called great people thought — why do we need God to build a tower? Let us use our intelligence, wisdom, and money to build it. Why do we need God's help? They started the tower without involving God. Depending on one's own wisdom and eloquence, they felt capable of doing the task and saw no need to talk to God about it. Why go to God and ask for help? The thought that they could do it without God's help is not right. It is not safe. Without God’s help and without His plan, their effort to gain a great name ended in failure (Genesis 11:5–9). All their dreams remained just dreams. The reason? There was no place for God in their effort. Likewise, if we try to build our life without God's help, it will one day collapse.

    <p>Dear friend, are you also thinking like this?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>I work hard day and night, but my income is not enough.</li>
      <li>I'm waiting for a salary hike, for my business to run well, but still no results.</li>
      <li>I'm afraid about my family, my health, and my future.</li>
      <li>I'm still living with the pain of losing someone.</li>
    </ul>
